## Peptides Binding Experiment

This presentation shows the binding affinity alteration of the peptide **\'RSPPDG\'** when each position is replaced by other amino acids. Original assay and data are provided by <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286741101350X>.


## Heatmap Plots
Heatmap is based on **gplots**.
```{r}
library(gplots, quietly=TRUE, warn.conflicts=FALSE)

cname <- c('R','S','P','P','D','G')
rname <- c('P','G','A','V','L','I','M','C','S','T','R','K','H','D','E','N','Q','W','F','Y')

act <- read.table('dataTable.txt', row.names=rname)
act <- as.matrix(act)

hm <- heatmap(act, Rowv=NA, Colv=NA, labCol=cname, col=heat.colors(120))
```

The darkness represents bindning affinity.
